# alx_be_python


## Overview

This project offers a gentle introduction to Python programming as part of the ALX curriculum. Designed to equip beginners with foundational skills which  explores Pythonâ€™s fundamentals, including its syntax, installation, and basic programming constructs.

## Tasks and Deliverables

### 0. Basic Arithmetic Exercise

**Objective:** Practice basic arithmetic operations with two predefined variables.

* Define `number1 = 10` and `number2 = 5`.
* Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication.
* Print results in a readable format.
* **File:** `basic_operations.py`


### 1. Simple Interest Calculator

**Objective:** Calculate simple interest using given principal, rate and time.

* Use variables: `principal = 1000`, `rate = 0.05`, `time = 3`.
* Calculate interest with `I = P * R * T`.
* Print the interest value.
* **File:** `simple_interest.py`

### 2. Calculate the Area of a Rectangle

**Objective:** Compute area by multiplying length and width.

* Variables: `length = 10`, `width = 5`.
* Calculate area and print result.
* **File:** `rectangle_area.py`

### 3. Convert Hours to Seconds

**Objective:** Convert a given number of hours to seconds.

* Define `hours = 2`.
* Calculate seconds (1 hour = 3600 seconds).
* Print result.
* **File:** `hours_to_seconds.py`


### 4. User Input Age Calculator

**Objective:** Accept user input to calculate age in a future year.

* Prompt for current age.
* Calculate age in 2050 (assuming current year 2023).
* Print result.
* **File:** `future_age_calculator.py`


### 5. Personal Finance Calculator *(Advanced)*

**Objective:** Calculate monthly savings and projected yearly savings including interest.

* Accept user input for monthly income and expenses.
* Calculate monthly savings (income - expenses).
* Project annual savings including 5% simple interest.
* Print savings and projection.
* **File:** `finance_calculator.py`

## How to Run the Scripts

All scripts are designed to run with Python 3. Run a script from the terminal or command line with the command:

```bash
python3 <script_name.py>
```

For example:

```bash
python3 basic_operations.py
```
